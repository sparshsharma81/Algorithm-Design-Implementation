graphs are mainly of two types 
1.Directed 
2.Undirected 

undirected means we can go back and fourth...bidirectional
..like we can move forward and backward

directed has two types 
1.weighted 
2.unweighted

implementing graph with the help of hashmap 

like nodes are vertex 
connecting things are edge 

HashMap k andar key me vertex rakhege 
aur value me graph kis kis se connected hai 
and then vo kis kisse connected hai
